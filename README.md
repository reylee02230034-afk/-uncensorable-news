# -uncensorable-news
An attempt to build a fully decentralized, censorship-resistant news system with no central server, no admin, and no authority.
# Decentralized News Protocol

This is an attempt to build a news system that cannot be shut down.

## What this is
A fully decentralized, censorship-resistant, text-only news protocol:
- No central server
- No admin
- No privileged accounts
- No centralized AI moderation

News exists because it is published — not because it is approved.

## Core principles
- Protocol over platform
- Censorship resistance over convenience
- No single point of failure
- AI provides suggestions, never authority

## What this is NOT
- Not a media company
- Not a content platform
- Not a social network
- Not a truth arbiter

## Current status
This project is at the **specification + MVP design stage**.
No production network exists yet.

## Get involved
If you care about:
- distributed systems
- peer-to-peer networks
- censorship resistance
- protocol design

Read the whitepaper and join the discussion.
