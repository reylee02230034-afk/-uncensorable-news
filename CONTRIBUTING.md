# Contributing

Before contributing, understand:

- There is no roadmap dictated by authority
- There are no maintainers with special power
- All decisions must be justified by protocol-level reasoning

If your proposal introduces:
- centralized services
- admin privileges
- moderation backdoors

It will be rejected.

Discuss ideas before writing large amounts of code.
