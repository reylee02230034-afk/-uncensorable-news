# Decentralized Censorship-Resistant News Network
## Whitepaper v1.0

This document describes a news protocol designed to survive
hostile governments, corporations, and infrastructure failures.

The goal is not to define truth,
but to ensure information cannot be erased by authority.

Decentralized Censorship-Resistant News Network Whitepaper (v1.0)

1. Background
This project aims to build a news system that cannot be shut down, censored,
or controlled by any single authority, corporation, or government.

2. Core Principles
1) Censorship resistance over convenience
2) Protocol over application
3) No central authority or admin
4) AI provides suggestions only, never final decisions

3. System Architecture
Client Nodes + P2P Network + Decentralized Storage + Public Blockchain

4. Identity System
Users generate decentralized identities (DID) locally via cryptographic keys.

5. News Content
News is content-addressed by cryptographic hash and is immutable once published.

6. Verification
Human consensus-based verification using geographically relevant participants.

7. Role of AI
AI assists with similarity detection and anomaly scoring but cannot censor content.

8. Discovery & Ranking
All ranking is performed locally on the client; no global feed exists.

9. Advertising & Revenue (Future)
All advertising revenue is distributed automatically to users via smart contracts.

10. Philosophy
We do not seek to define truth.
We seek to ensure the right for information to exist cannot be destroyed.
